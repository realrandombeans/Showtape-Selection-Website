        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p>Hiya, I'm randombeans, the founder of Showtape Selection. I'll make this quick, don't worry.</p>
        <p>We're a community filled with hundreds of members who all share one main interest - animatronics! 
        Or they're just here for fun, we can't forget about those! We started up in October 2022, and as of writing 
        this we are about a month away from our birthday, so yippee! Anyways, we've been regarded as one of 
        THE MOST welcoming communities to be in, and it is my aim for everybody in our community to feel safe 
        and welcome. If you have any questions, by all means, contact us and if you're lucky you might be able to even talk to me!</p>
        <p><i>Now, I would write the rest of this, but as of writing this it is 12:26 AM and my eyes hurt.</i></p>
