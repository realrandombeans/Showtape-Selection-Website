		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p><b>Charles Entertainment Cheese</b> (shortened as Chuck E Cheese) is the main mascot of Chuck E Cheese. He is the main singer and guitarist of <a href="/chuckecheese/bands/makebelieve.html">Munch's Make Believe Band</a>.</p>

		<h1>History</h1>
		<h3>Pizza Time Theatre</h3>
		<p>
			The original concept for the character that would become Chuck E. was initially "Rick Rat,"
			but Atari promptly dismissed the idea, deeming it too mature for young audiences.
			The moniker "Chuck E. Cheese" was eventually chosen, both for its alliteration akin
			to Mickey Mouse and its three-smile name appeal. In his inaugural showtape first debuted at Winchester,
			Chuck E. portrayed a markedly distinct persona compared to later iterations,
			drawing inspiration from the character "Muggs McGinnis." He embodied the
			quintessential rat persona, unabashedly poking fun at fellow stage characters.
			<br /><br /> In the early days, he even sported a cigar in the early animatronic portrait figures <sup><a href="https://images6.fanpop.com/image/photos/40800000/Chuck-E-Cheese-Alternate-2nd-Gen-Portrait-Animatronic-chuck-e-cheeses-40889632-392-550.jpg">ref</a></sup>.
			However, this aspect was phased out in subsequent shows, Cyberamics performances,
			and other media during the 1980 Great American Smoke Out initiative. <br /><br /> Chuck E. would
			often be seen with a brown vaudeville cane in hand <sup><a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/showbiz-pizza-time-theatre/images/5/50/C3c.webp/revision/latest?cb=20221017005427">ref</a></sup>, although he didn't play any musical
			instruments. As the host of Pizza Time Theatre, he primarily wielded a microphone,
			doubling as a vocalist who would belt out tunes, much to the chagrin of the rest of the
			Pizza Time Players. <br /> <br /> His birthday fell on May 22nd, and he was known to become
			excessively exuberant about birthdays, often indulging in hearty laughter at his own jokes.
			Chuck E.'s distinguishing features included his unmistakable New Jersey accent, his penchant
			for cracking jokes and playful insults, his iconic red derby hat, a perpetually large grin adorning
			his face, and a penchant for winking at his numerous friends and fans.
		</p>
		<h3>Early 1990s (Tux/Coach Chuck)</h3>
		<p>
			In a narrative spanning back to the late 1980s, a transformative chapter
			unfolded for the beloved Chuck E. Cheese character. Showbiz Pizza Time,
			the corporate guardian overseeing the realms of Showbiz Pizza Place and
			Chuck E. Cheese's, made a decisive break from Aaron Fechter, the 
			mastermind behind the Rock-afire-Explosion. This strategic move catalyzed
			Showbiz Pizza Time's commitment to harnessing the potential of the
			Chuck E. Cheese brand, which they had acquired back in 1984, during
			Chuck E. Cheese's resurgence from bankruptcy under SPT. This pivotal
			juncture marked the genesis of a unification of the two chains, rebranded
			under the fresh banner of "Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza," a name succinctly
			altered to "Chuck E. Cheese's" in 1994. This rebranding endeavor culminated
			in the gradual phasing out of all vestiges of the Rock-afire-Explosion characters,
			heralding the ascendance of Chuck E. Cheese's own cast of characters. By 1992,
			the complete transformation of existing Showbiz Pizza Place locales into Chuck E. Cheese's establishments was a fait accompli.
			<br /> <br />
			Showbiz Pizza Time engaged the creative prowess of Peeler-Rose Productions,
			a Texas-based company, to embark on a comprehensive brand metamorphosis.
			Chuck E. Cheese himself underwent a sartorial evolution, trading in his
			previous image for a more dapper look, featuring a tuxedo while
			retaining his signature derby hat. His visage was likewise revamped
			into a more whimsical and animated persona. The vocal portrayal of
			Chuck E. Cheese initially rested in the capable hands of Scott Wilson, a role subsequently assumed by Duncan Brannan in January 1994.
			<br /> <br />
			To maintain its competitive edge in the ever-evolving landscape of family entertainment,
			Showbiz Pizza Time orchestrated yet another dramatic transformation of the
			Chuck E. Cheese character in 1994. This revamp ushered in "Tux," who alternated
			with a fresh design known as "Coach Chuck." This overhaul also ushered in a
			softer, less rodent-like countenance for both character iterations, officially
			transitioning Chuck E. Cheese into a decidedly more mouse-like appearance.
			The two designs briefly coexisted until Showbiz Pizza Time unveiled
			"Cool Chuck" in 1999, rendering both previous incarnations obsolete.
			Nevertheless, echoes of the "Tux" design lingered in the restaurant's existing
			décor, animatronic costumes (with the last one being removed in May 2014
			in Attleboro, MA), and "Tux" walkaround costumes, which continued to circulate
			as alternative outfits until 2004.
		</p>
		<h3>Early 2000s (Cool/Avenger Chuck)</h3>
		<p>

			The dawn of Chuck E.'s third incarnation emerged in the vibrant year of 1997.
			He retained his timeless personality but was reserved exclusively for the realm
			of commercials. Clad in the attire of a hip and skateboard-loving enthusiast,
			this new Chuck E. incarnation, aptly named Avenger Chuck, paid homage to
			the legacy of Tux Chuck while forging his own path as an entertainer alongside
			his friends. With an unwavering commitment to maintaining order and ensuring
			a seamless experience, Avenger Chuck E. stood as the embodiment of the "every man"
			entertainer. At the core of his persona lay an earnest affection for his guests, their
			enjoyment, and a deep desire to be wherever they gathered. Notably, he showcased
			his musical talents by serenading audiences with the saxophone and occasionally the electric guitar, a musical flair that graced both showtapes and commercials.
			<br /> <br />
			In the same transformative year of 1997, a fresh concept known as Studio C was
			unveiled to the public, marking yet another shift in Chuck E.'s persona.
			Jeremy Blaido lent his voice to Chuck E. during this period, a role he would
			later assume for Jasper T. Jowls starting in 1999. Duncan, the long-standing
			voice of Chuck E. in most commercials, continued to contribute his vocal
			talents. Studio C aimed to replicate the ambiance of a talk show studio, an
			endeavor that bestowed Chuck E. with a slightly more subdued personality.
			<br /> <br />
			However, as financial constraints prevented CEC Entertainment from implementing
			Studio C on all stages, the talk show format was eventually abandoned in favor of
			returning to the beloved band dynamic. It was during this transitional phase that
			Avenger Chuck E. truly found his footing. Duncan resumed his role as the voice of
			Chuck E. on a full-time basis, seamlessly taking over from Blaido, and continued to embody this iconic character until the year 2012.

		<h3>Early 2010s (Rockstar Chuck)</h3>
		<p>
			In the early 2010s, spurred by a significant sales decline, they embarked on a dramatic overhaul of Chuck E. Cheese—
			an endeavor not undertaken since 1997. Their goal was to rejuvenate their restaurants, making them more appealing
			to the tech-savvy kids of the 21st century. The first glimpse of the revamped character emerged as a silhouette on the
			official Chuck E. Cheese Facebook page in June 2012, with the official unveiling occurring later that month. This
			transformation prompted an immediate shift in their advertising strategy with the introduction of the "Say Cheese, It's Funner"
			campaign for June. This marked a significant departure, as the character now made its debut in CGI in promotional materials,
			replacing the earlier hand-drawn Avenger ads.
			<br /> <br />
			The transition also extended to the character's voice, with Duncan Brannan being replaced by Jaret Reddick, the lead singer
			of the band Bowling For Soup. This redesign was met with substantial backlash from devoted fans and regular patrons of
			Chuck E. Cheese, who found it to be a stark departure from the beloved previous versions. It is often linked to the financial
			difficulties that plagued the company thereafter. Chuck E. Cheese's personality underwent yet another transformation,
			adopting a more rockstar-like demeanor that didn't necessarily resonate with the contemporary generation of children.
			In the shows, he often sought to assert his individuality, but was thwarted by other characters, leading to moments of frustration.
			Nevertheless, he remained dedicated to connecting with kids and taking birthdays seriously.

			<h4>Voice Actor Controversy</h4>

			The unveiling of the new advertising campaign also brought about unexpected controversy,
			revolving around the choice of a new voice actor. Jaret Reddick, renowned as the lead vocalist of the band Bowling for Soup,
			was tapped to provide both the singing and speaking voice for Chuck E. Cheese in the campaign. In the days preceding the
			campaign launch, Chuck E. Cheese teased "Chuck's Hot New Single" through an email to members of their email club. Upon
			receiving this email, a group of fans reached out to Duncan Brannan for further clarification. After listening to the song and
			making inquiries within CEC's corporate offices, Duncan Brannan discovered that he had been replaced. He promptly issued a press release to inform the fans.
			<br /> <br />
			Within days, local news outlets in the Dallas area picked up on the story, and it quickly gained traction across the internet,
			appearing on national news outlets and prominent blogs like Gawker, Perez Hilton, and the Huffington Post. On May 1st, the
			Associated Press (AP) published an article on the matter, which was subsequently distributed to numerous media outlets. CEC
			Entertainment, Inc. responded by denying that Duncan Brannan had been "fired," asserting that despite his freelance status,
			he remained under contract with the company to provide entertainment in its restaurants.
