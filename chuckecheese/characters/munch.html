		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p><b>Mr. Munch</b> is a purple monster who is the keyboard player and songwriter of <a href="/chuckecheese/bands/makebelieve.html">Munch's Make Believe Band</a>, He is the only main character to not appear in the original Winchester restaurant.</p>

		<h1>History</h1>
		<h3>Pizza Time Theatre</h3>
		<p>
			The concept of Mr. Munch was conceived by Michael M. Hatcher, the director of entertainment at Pizza Time Theatre.
			Hatcher envisioned a monster character to join the cast of main characters. When Mr. Munch made his debut, he notably
			stood out as the only main character who did not appear in the original restaurant setting.
			<br /> <br />
			As part of his original character design, Mr. Munch was depicted as having a slower wit compared to the other main cast
			members, although this distinction has become less pronounced over time. Initially, he was voiced by Scott Wilson,
			who gave him a scratchy voice that contributed to his unique character.
			<br /> <br />
			During his first appearance on the Shelf stage, Mr. Munch, alongside Pasqually, was positioned behind a set of double doors.
			With the introduction of the balcony stage, Mr. Munch was relocated to the far left side of the stage, a position he would
			maintain until the creation of Munch's Make Believe Band.
		</p>
		<h3>Early 1990s (Tux Munch)</h3>
		<p>
			During Concept Unification, Mr. Munch underwent a significant redevelopment, emerging as the leader of the newly formed
			"Munch's Make Believe Band." In this era, he assumed a prominent center stage position, akin to the strong stage presence of Fatz Geronimo. This positioning underscored his importance within the band.
			<br /> <br />
			While Scott Wilson continued to provide the voice for Mr. Munch during this period, the character's voice evolved. Mr. Munch's
			voice deepened, becoming more reminiscent of Fatz's voice, adding to his commanding presence on stage.
			<br /> <br />
			In terms of appearance, Mr. Munch sported a distinctive cap and green sneakers during this era, further distinguishing his look
			within the band.
			<br /> <br />
			Subsequently, Duncan Brannan took over as the voice of Mr. Munch, especially in the shows produced after Disney's involvement,
			marking a transition in the character's portrayal.
		</p>
		<h3>Early 1990s (Avenger Munch)</h3>
		<p>
			Avenger Mr. Munch represents the third iteration of the Munch character, bearing similarities to the Tux era version.
			This version of Munch made its debut in 2001 and remained the active incarnation of the character until 2013.
			During this period, Munch was voiced by John Bowen from 1999 to 2014, providing continuity in his vocal portrayal.
			<br /> <br />
			Munch's appearance in the Avenger era typically featured him wearing his iconic orange "Eat More" shirt. However,
			in contrast to the Rockstar Era, there were instances where Munch was depicted without pants as part of his outfit.
			This unique character trait added a touch of whimsy to his appearance during this era.
		</p>
		<h3>Early 1990s (Rockstar Munch)</h3>
		<p>
			Rockstar Munch's backstory is both intriguing and entertaining. He originates from the fictional Planet Purple,
			along with his sibling Munch Jr. He comes from a large family, and although many of his relatives have visited
			Earth, notably for appearances at Chuck E. Cheese's, his parents have yet to make an appearance, with his mother
			only making an audio cameo in a Bootacular 2020 spot.
			<br /> <br />
			Before venturing to Earth, it was customary for residents of Planet Purple to explore other worlds.
			Munch spent a significant amount of time practicing the keyboard and conducting research on various planets.
			However, his fascination with Earth's pizza was a turning point in his journey. After landing in New York City,
			he became enamored with the pizza he had only seen in his studies. This newfound love led him to Chuck E. Cheese's.
			<br /> <br />
			Munch's introduction to the Chuck E. Cheese's band was serendipitous, as he had the opportunity to play the keyboard with the group.
			Shortly thereafter, he secured a job at the establishment, becoming a beloved member of the team.
			<br /> <br />
			In addition to his musical talents, Munch embraced the role of a DJ, assuming the alter ego of "DJ Munch" as a hobby. This multi-faceted character adds depth and charm to Rockstar Munch's persona.
