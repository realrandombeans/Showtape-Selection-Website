		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p><b>Helen Henny</b> is the main vocalist of <a href="/chuckecheese/bands/makebelieve.html">Munch's Make Believe Band</a>. She was the only female main character in the band until Bella Bunny was introduced.</p>

		<h1>History</h1>
		<h3>Pizza Time Theatre</h3>
		<p>
			In August 1977, a hen named Helen made her debut, and her name was a humorous homage to the Australian singer and actress Helen Reddy. During the brief Portrait era,
			Helen was a guitar-playing character who had recently returned from a tour in Madagascar. To this day, the original Helen Henny Showtape remains missing and is considered lost.
			In February 1978, she was replaced by Madam Oink (later renamed "Madame Oink").
			<br /> <br />
			In 1979, Helen reappeared in a Cyberamic form, with her design remaining somewhat consistent but her backstory evolving. She was now portrayed as a movie star working for
			"Eggstravagant Motion Pictures."
			<br /> <br />
			In 1983, Helen took on the persona of the "Broadway Hen." She played a crucial role as the final Guest Star before the Pizza Time Theatre faced financial troubles. Her on-stage
			performance aimed to impress a talent scout from Broadway, and during this time, she developed a habit of clucking between sentences, much to the annoyance of Chuck E. Cheese.
			Even after the company's financial struggles made character changes unfeasible, Helen continued to be the permanent female character.
			<br /> <br />
			Paula Mulcahy, who initially voiced Helen, was replaced by Nancy Lenihan in 1986 when production of the showtapes shifted to ShowBiz Pizza Time in Texas.
			<br /> <br />
			During the construction of the C and Rocker Stages, Helen's outfit underwent a slight modification. Her dress lost its glitter and adopted a polka-dotted pattern, enhancing her versatility as a character.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h3>Early 1990s (Tux Helen)</h3>
			During the period of Concept Unification, Helen underwent a significant redesign aimed at making her appear younger. This transformation was driven by ShowBiz's desire to maintain Mitzi Mozzarella's
			appeal to young girls as a crucial aspect of their market strategy. As part of the makeover, Helen now sported pigtails instead of her previous hairstyle, and she lost the comb and wattles that characterized
			her Pizza Time Theatre design. Her beak was also softened to create a more youthful appearance.
			<br /> <br />
			Nancy continued to provide the voice for Helen until the year 1991, at which point Karlisa McKinney assumed the role. In May 1992, Annagrey Labassee took over as Helen's singing voice, a role she would
			maintain throughout the 1990s, except for instances of recasting by Disney.
			<br /> <br />
			In 1995, a significant wardrobe change occurred for Helen as she adopted a green cheerleading outfit, and her hair color shifted to blonde.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h3>Early 2000s (Avenger Helen)</h3>
		<p>
			In the Summertime of 2000, Annagrey Labasse assumed the role of Helen Henny as the full-time voice, taking over from Karlisa McKinney who had departed.
			This change coincided with a subtle shift in Helen's character, portraying her as slightly older than before. During this era, Helen's apparent crush on Chuck E.
			Cheese became much more evident. She playfully teased him on stage, often leading to his nervousness, shyness, or quick attempts to change the subject.
			<br /> <br />
			Helen also took on a new role as a source of wisdom within the band, stepping in when the other characters engaged in teasing or when challenging situations arose.
			Her guidance aimed to promote harmony among the band members.
			<br /> <br />
			Throughout this period, Helen's appearance underwent two redesigns that were interchanged with each other. The cheerleader outfit, while retired from regular use,
			remained in rotation as the walkaround costume until 2017. Additionally, a purple version of her outfit, introduced in 1994, became more commonly featured in shows.
		</p>
		<h3>Early 2010s (Rockstar Helen)</h3>
		<p>
			In 2014, Helen underwent a redesign, refreshing her appearance. However, her voice remained unchanged until 2016 when it was altered.
			<br /> <br />
			During this time, Helen began taking piano lessons from Munch, showcasing her musical talents. She developed a love for reading and
			embraced a loyal and positive personality, always displaying kindness towards her friends. While her crush on Chuck E. was still present,
			it became less apparent compared to previous portrayals. Helen also developed a keen interest in dinosaurs, likely inspired by the fact that
			chickens are considered descendants of these ancient creatures. In one showtape, she even played the acoustic guitar, demonstrating her musical versatility.
			<br /> <br />
			Helen embraced gaming and became a video game enthusiast, known for being a good sport in her gaming endeavors. She expanded her
			repertoire by showcasing her driving skills in "Summer Road Trip" and demonstrated her ability to ride a bike.
			<br /> <br />
			Additionally, Helen formed a friendship outside the band with Bella the Bunny. However, in 2018, Bella joined the band as a member, further
			expanding Helen's social circle within the group.
