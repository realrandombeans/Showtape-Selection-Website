		<h1>Preparations</h1>
		<p>
			SC Entertainment was founded in March 1992, from an entrepreneur called Avery Beaumont.
			Beaumont had originally aspired to franchise a CEC location, however upon visiting several
			he noticed flaws in their management, instead aspiring to buy out a failing franchise and
			turn it into a new store, with many alterations which he felt would benefit the business.
			While waiting for a suitable store to buy, he tasked some freelance designers to draw
			some concepts for 3-stage retrofits. He then took those concepts to Mr Star, an artist
			who had previously done work for other animatronic shows.
			Within a few months, a new cast of characters had been fully designed and were ready
			to be produced, when the opportunity arose. In February 1993, a CEC in Wisconsin closed down,
			which Beaumont quickly bought. He tasked an unknown company to create cosmetics and
			props, which were retrofitted onto the 3-stage bots. Meanwhile, another unknown company
			created a showtape for the premiere of the show, which has been mostly lost. Segment 1 is
			rumoured to be in a collector's archive, while segments 2 and 3 are considered lost media.
		</p>
		<h1>Opening</h1>
		<p>
			Swift's Pizza Place opened in August 1994, and was fairly successful until May 1996, 
			when a CEC (using a 3 stage from a closed down store) opened up nearby in direct 
			competition, causing Swift's to lose business and eventually close, shutting it's doors 
			on December 30th 1996. The stage decor, bots and some decor around the store were saved and put into storage.
			Beaumont, however, was not deterred. Determined to succeed in the family entertainment 
			centre market, he began planning an improved location in a new area, with enough demand 
			and no competition. Star, who had been still working for the company doing promotional art, 
			pitched his own unique show, the Bark Street Band, using a new stage and some modified mechs. 
			Sometime in 1997, an ex CEI employee was tasked with modifying the pianist and guitarist mechs 
			to fit the new cast of characters, to put on a custom stage in a new restaurant that Beaumont had 
			found, converted from a closed down grocery store.
		</p>
		<h1>Conversion</h1>
		<p>
			As the store was converted, new cosmetics were made for the BSB, however some cosmetics 
			from SSB survived into BSB, such as Swift's blazer (reembroidered to have a B on the pocket), 
			bow tie and top hat as well as the Woodpecker's tartan shirt. The rest of the swift cosmetics 
			and props were kept in storage. It opened in June 1998 and performed decently well. The CEC 
			in Wisconsin that had competed with Swift's was now struggling financially; in April 1999 it was 
			bought out by SC Entertainment and its 3 stage was converted into a SSB, using the old backdrops 
			and props from the first location, with most of the old cosmetics, however new masks were made 
			and swift had to have a new blazer made, as well as many other minor cosmetic replacements.
		</p>
		<h1>Opening of the New Swift's</h1>
		<p>
			The new Swift's opened in November of 1999, throwing an extremely popular grand opening. 
			In January of 2002, SC entertainment bought out another CEC location, retrofitting the road stage 
			cyberamics into swift characters with a custom stage and broadening their market. The location 
			opened in August 2002 and was the most successful Swift's location due to the location of the 
			store. The new location initially earned a huge boost in profits, but it was fairly short-lived. 
			Through the early 2000s, the company began to see a decline in profits and despite their best efforts, 
			they were losing money by 2004. Bark Street was the first store to close, shutting its doors on April 2nd 2005.
		</p>
		<h1>Closing</h1>
		<p>
			The second 3 stage Swift's closed a few months later, on October 15 of that same year. 
			The bots and props from both locations were put into storage. The cyber location was 
			the most profitable due to the area it was in and lasted until September 1st 2006. 
			All the assets were put up for sale at a public auction later that year. The Bark Street 
			bots went to an anonymous private collector while the Swift cybers were sold to an 
			unknown theme park. The 3-stage Swift bots were kept in storage due to bids not 
			reaching the desired amount, intended to go up in a future auction.
			However, no such auction came; they were left abandoned in storage before being 
			rediscovered in 2019 and bought by a private collector, who is in the process of slowly 
			restoring them. The Swift JR bot is mysteriously missing from the lot, some think that 
			an employee stole it as a keepsake. As for the cybers, no evidence of them has surfaced; 
			their location is a mystery. The Bark Street bots were restored by the collecter, though 
			haven't been shown publicly. The only evidence comes from a few leaked photos of restored characters.
