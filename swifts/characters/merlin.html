		<h1>History</h1>
		<p><i> Merlin was introduced in 1993 at the opening of the first Swift's Pizza. She was the female vocalist and took many leads, being a prominent character in marketing
			and merchandise. She didn't top the popularity of main character Swift, but came close, being a favourite among many fans for her fun and sweet personality. However, 
			much of her appeal came from her wild side; she could really rock out and get wild, taking the spotlight in many rock covers and delighting audiences. She remained the 
			same throughout the turbulent period in the 90s, seemingly mellowing out slightly as the years progressed, due to the shift in focus from rock songs to songs for a 
			wider audience. Her walkaround outfit was introduced in the second Swift's location in 1999, remaining faithful to her cartoon counterpart used in promotional images. 
			Throughout the early 2000s, she didn't undergo any changes, however in 2005, as the company was struggling to stay afloat, it was decided to give her cartoon counterpart 
			a more modern makeover, featuring a miniskirt and t-shirt. This was not well-recieved, but didn't make much of an impact, as she was only featured on printed merch and 
			promotional art; costumes for the animatronic and walkaround were too expensive. Before long, with the closure of the final location in 2006, Merlin and the rest of the 
			gang faded into obscurity. She would be reborn in December of 2022, when Showtape Selection bought the rights to the characters and she was digitally revived in Showtape
			Central </i></p>
