		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p><b>Swift Defoxxe</b> is a fox who is the main singer and lead of Swift's Superb Show. He is the main mascot for Swift's Pizza, ran by SC entertainment from 1993 to 2006.
			 He resides on stage left, with naturecam/kookaburra to his left. </p>
		<h1>Appearance</h1>
		<p>Swift is an orange fox with a white patch on his chest and throat, donning a top hat with red ribbon and a navy blazer embroidered with the initial 'S', as well as a red
			 bow tie. His official design as well as his animatronic depicts him with dark brown colouring that faded from his feet to his calves, like real red foxes, however some 
			 promotial art doesn't seem to show this. </p>
		<h1>History</h1>
		<p><i>He was first conceptualised in 1992, to be the mascot of the proposed Swift's Pizza location. Some early desgins and promotional art for investors depicted him with a
			  dark grey shirt with a white square around the neck and white rings around the sleeves. However, this appearance was short-lived, only being known in a few early pieces.
			  Soon, he had his iconic navy blazer and top hat, as well as his red bow tie. He made his debut when Swift's PIzza opened in 1993, with a retrofitted CU Chuck E Cheese 
			  mech. He was the only character to have a walkaround costume in the first store, his walkaround being faithful to the promotional art. The same walkaround design was used 
			  all subsequent locations as well. Upon the opening of the second location in 1998, his animatronic was almost identical, reusing the fur from the original Swift bot, 
			  however new clothing and accesories were made, as well as a new mask. This mask was redder in skin tone than the previous, with more blush. When the third Swift's Pizza 
			  location opened in 2002, Swift recieved a new half-bodied cyberamic, with a fairly faithful design. In 2003 a redesign was proposed to modernise him, that was said to have
			  featured a baseball cap and a t-shirt, but nothing else is known of it due to its abrupt dismissal. When Swift's Pizza finally closed in 2006, the rights to Swift and his
			  bandmates were up in the air, before being bought in December 2022 by Showtape Selection, owned by Randombeans, to be recreated in a game called Showtape Central.  </i></p>
